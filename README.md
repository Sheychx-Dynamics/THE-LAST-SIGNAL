  <i><b>The Architecture of Chaos:</b> High-tier vertical mobility, industrial brutalism, and eldritch threats unified in one stable environment (V2.4).</i>
</p>

- **Hybrid AI Architecture:** Implementation of StateTree-optimized enemy classes combined with robust, simplified AI methods for reliable combat flow and performance scaling.
- **Immersion-Focused UI:** The system remains functional and accessible without breaking the atmospheric seal.

*Internal Debug Suite (V2.4) for real-time system stress testing and environment calibration.*

### 🏗️ SYSTEM STATS (Ref. Manifest SD-V2.4)
* **Optimized Payload:** Effective size reduced to 2,46 GB (Repacked Build). Eliminating 60GB of overhead in favor of industrial-grade efficiency.
* **1,800+ High-Quality Assets:** Radically migrated and verified for the V2.4 production state.
* **Shader Core:** Optimized SM5 workflow ensuring visual fidelity and high performance across all targeted systems.
