  <i><b>The Architecture of Chaos:</b> High-tier vertical mobility and optimized AI agents unified in the V2.6 Shipping Build.</i>
</p>

- **V2.6 Hybrid AI (The "Lazy AI" Method):** Optimized for high-density encounters using a decoupled 5s-logic-tick throttled system.
- **Physical Overlap Overrides:** Instant AI reactivity via physics-based triggers, bypassing idle latency for seamless combat engagement.
- **Shipping Build Milestone:** Confirmed **30-40 FPS with 30+ active AI agents** running on **RTX 2070 Mobile** hardware.
- **Persistent Logic:** Custom recovery loops to handle MoveTo-failures and NavMesh crowding without CPU spikes.

## 🏗️ THE ARCHITECTURE | V2.6 PERFORMANCE DATA
> **V2.6 is Live.** This update shifts from editor-based prototyping to standalone shipping build stability.

### 🧪 PERFORMANCE BENCHMARK (TEST: 3)
* **Status:** Milestone Reached – Stable Standalone Build.
* **Target Hardware:** Optimized for Mobile Chipsets (Laptop/Mid-Range).
* **Current Data:** 30-40 FPS (Min: 27 FPS during heavy overlap spikes).
* **Next Goal:** Scaling to 50+ agents while maintaining sub-30ms frame times.
